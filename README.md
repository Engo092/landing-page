# Odin Landing Page 2.0

This is a project mostly focused on CSS and flexbox-related skills. I myself have never had a good relation with CSS, especially flexbox, so making this project and being able to actually make it look good is definitively something that I'm proud of.

I followed very closely the design shown on The Odin Project, so many things are currently "placeholders", but with very little effort it can become a very professional-looking website.

The way I created this website was that I initially started and finished the HTML page first, adding divs where was necessary. I only needed to do minor changes once or twice while styling it with CSS.

I then moved on to CSS and did everything from top-to-bottom. It is a pretty extensive style.css, but it looks very nice. It took me around 1-2 hours to style it completely, as i had done the flexbox exercises of The Odin Project, so there were many things that I was already familiar with. In general this project made me way more comfortable with CSS.

This is the 2.0 update, created as I was revisiting my The Odin Project projects. With this one, I was actually really satisfied with it already, so the main change is the addition of mobile support. This means it now also looks good on mobile devices, which is a very important skill to learn and get comfortable with in CSS.
