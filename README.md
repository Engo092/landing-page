# Odin Landing Page

This is a project mostly focused on CSS and flexbox-related skills. I myself have never had a good relation with CSS, especially flexbox, so making this project and being able to actually make it look good is definitively something that i loved doing.

I followed very closely the design shown on The Odin Project, so many things are currently placeholders, but with very little effort it can look like a very professional website.

The way i created this website was that i initially started and finished my HTML page first, adding divs where i thought was necessary. I only needed to do minor changes once or twice while styling it.

Afterwards i moved on to CSS and did everything from top-to-bottom. It is a pretty extensive style.css, but it looks very nice. It took me around 1-2 hours to style it completely, as i had done the flexbox exercises of The Odin Project so there were many things that i was already familiar with. In general this project made me way more comfortable with CSS.
